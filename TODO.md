# TODO: Fix Admin 404 Layout

## Tasks
- [x] Revert `app/admin/layout.tsx` to original state to avoid affecting other admin pages.
- [x] Ensure `app/admin/not-found.tsx` includes AdminSidebar and AdminHeader for 404-specific admin layout.
- [x] Adjust AdminHeader title in 404 to "Page Not Found" for clarity.

## Notes
- Changes limited to admin 404 page only, as per user clarification.
- Other admin pages remain unchanged to avoid duplication issues.
- Task complete: Admin 404 now displays with sidebar and header.
